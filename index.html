								<h2>First International Trophy<br /></h2>
								<p> Portugal won their very first Euro title in 2016 with a dramatic win over the host team, France.
									Ronaldo was injured after just 25 minutes of the final game which made him leave the pitch in tears. It was a
									closely-fought contest and Protugal beat France thanks to Eder's late-minute winner in the 109 minute.
									Ronaldo played a key role despite being forced to leave the pitch and remained as a hero of the game.
